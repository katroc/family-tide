# Family Planner - SQLite Version

Your project has been successfully restored to use SQLite instead of Supabase!

## What I Fixed

✅ **Created missing files:**
- `dataService.ts` - SQLite-based data service
- `services/authService.ts` - Mock authentication service 
- `components/SupabaseTests.tsx` - Stub components for removed Supabase tests

✅ **Updated existing files:**
- `App.tsx` - Removed Supabase dependencies, simplified auth logic
- `types.ts` - Updated to work with SQLite (numeric IDs converted to strings)
- `package.json` - Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency

✅ **Backed up old files:**
- `supabaseService.ts` → `supabaseService.ts.backup`

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd "D:\Coding\family-planner"
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## How It Works Now

- **Database**: Uses SQLite with sql.js in the browser
- **Data Storage**: Stored in browser localStorage 
- **Authentication**: Mock service (always logged in)
- **Setup**: App will show setup wizard first time you run it

## Features Restored

- ✅ Family member management
- ✅ Chore tracking and assignment  
- ✅ Rewards system
- ✅ Routines and daily progress
- ✅ Calendar events
- ✅ Family photos
- ✅ All UI components

## Key Changes from Supabase Version

1. **No real authentication** - Uses mock auth service that auto-logs you in
2. **Local data only** - All data stored in browser localStorage
3. **Numeric IDs** - Uses auto-incrementing integers instead of UUIDs
4. **Simplified setup** - No server setup required

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Clear browser data:** Clear localStorage and refresh
2. **Check console:** Open browser dev tools for error messages
3. **Dependencies:** Make sure all npm packages are installed

## Next Steps

Your app should now work perfectly with SQLite! The setup wizard will guide you through creating your first family and adding members.

**Note:** Since this uses localStorage, your data will persist in the browser but won't sync across devices. If you need cloud sync in the future, we can set up a proper backend service.
