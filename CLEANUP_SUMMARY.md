# Family Planner - Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 Files Moved to `to_remove/` Folder

The following unused files have been moved to the `to_remove/` folder and can be safely deleted:

### Unused Files:
1. **`components/types.ts`** 
   - Duplicate type definitions that were never imported by any component
   - All components define their own interfaces inline

2. **`RESTORED_README.md`**
   - Outdated documentation from SQLite version
   - No longer relevant since project has been migrated to Supabase

### Backup Files (.bak):
3. **`components/FamilyCreationTest.tsx.bak`**
   - Test component backup from previous cleanup

4. **`components/Stage4Test.tsx.bak`**
   - Test component backup from previous cleanup  

5. **`serviceAbstraction.ts.bak`**
   - Service abstraction layer backup from SQLite migration

## 🎨 Icon Display Issues Fixed

### Problem:
- Icons throughout the app were showing text like "money", "gift", "star" instead of actual emoji characters
- Inconsistent icon mapping between different components
- Each component had its own icon mapping logic

### Solution:
- **Created centralized icon utility**: `utils/iconUtils.ts`
- **Comprehensive icon mapping**: Maps 60+ text names to emoji characters
- **Consistent icon functions**: `getIcon()`, `getRewardIcons()`, `getChoreIcons()`
### Components Updated:
1. **`ChoresTab.tsx`**
   - Fixed chore icon display in both "Today's Tasks" and "All Chores" sections
   - Fixed reward icon display in "Available Rewards" section

2. **`AddRewardModal.tsx`**
   - Replaced local iconMap with centralized utility
   - Updated icon selection grid to use `getRewardIcons()`

3. **`RoutinesTab.tsx`**
   - Fixed routine step icon display

4. **`ManageChoreTypesModal.tsx`**
   - Fixed chore type icon display in the list

5. **`ManageRoutinesModal.tsx`**
   - Fixed routine step icon display in editing view

6. **`AddChoreModal.tsx`**
   - Fixed chore type icon display in dropdown
   - Fixed icon preview display

7. **`types.ts`**
   - Updated `DEFAULT_REWARD_ICONS` to use actual emoji characters instead of text names

8. **`App.tsx`**
   - Updated to use new icon utility functions
   - Removed dependency on old text-based icon constants

## ✨ Icon Utility Features

### `getIcon(iconName, fallback)`
- Converts text names like 'money' → '💰'
- Handles emoji characters (passes through unchanged)
- Provides fallback for unknown icons

### Icon Categories:
- **Reward Icons**: 🎁 ⭐ 🏆 🏅 👑 💰 🎮 🎬 🍕 🍦 🎈
- **Chore Icons**: 🧹 🧺 🍽️ 🚮 🐶 🍃 🛠️ 🛒 🧑‍🍳 📚 🛏️ 🌱
- **Action Icons**: ✅ ✓ ➕ ✏️ 🗑️ 💾 ❌
- **Navigation Icons**: 🏠 📅 📋 🔄 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 ⚙️
## 🎯 Result

- **Clean codebase**: No unused files cluttering the project
- **Consistent icon display**: All icons now show as emoji characters
- **Centralized icon management**: Easy to add/modify icons in one place
- **Better user experience**: Users see actual icons instead of confusing text

## 📁 Next Steps

1. **Delete `to_remove/` folder** when you're confident everything works correctly
2. **Test the application** to ensure all icons display properly
3. **Consider adding more icons** to the utility as needed

## 🚀 Ready for Development

Your family planner is now:
- ✅ **Clean and organized** with no unused files
- ✅ **Visually consistent** with proper icon display  
- ✅ **Maintainable** with centralized icon management
